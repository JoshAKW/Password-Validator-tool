// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle
     and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined.\
 Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where the product requirments are specified, documented and approved."

const design = "This is the third step, where the architecture of the product is developed, usually there are several aproaches proposed\
 based on the product requirements, as well as other concerns (such as time, budget, robustness, modularity etc.)\
 the best design will be selected."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, where the product is developed and built. The coding is generated per\
 the previous stages results."

const testingIntegration = "This is the fifth step, where the product is tested for defects. Defects are reported, fixed, and retested.\
 Beta testers are often used in this regard (I think haha)"

const maintain = "This is the final and continous step, where the product is maintained in the face of updates,\
 changing system requirements etc."
